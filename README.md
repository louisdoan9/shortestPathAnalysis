# shortestPathAnalysis

### Overview

This project is the final assignment for COMPSCI 2XC3: Algorithms & Software Design. It focuses on implementing, analyzing, and comparing various shortest path algorithms through empirical experiments. Originally completed by a team of three, this version has been refined for clarity and ease of understanding without needing the context within the course.

### Code

The code for this project is written in Python and can be found in the provided folder. The project utilizes the following libraries:

- timeit: For measuring the execution time of each algorithm.
- matplotlib: For plotting multiple execution times of the algorithm.

The project also includes CSV files containing information about the London subway system, which are used in some of the experiments.

### Report

A detailed report of the overall findings is available in the included PDF file.
